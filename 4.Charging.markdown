##Problem:##

How can you charge the electrics, no matter how few, needed to operate
H.O.P.S.?

##Solution:##

The battery that powers the electrics of H.O.P.S. can be charged while
the H.O.P.S. is in use. A piezoelectric material will coat the pilot's
gloves. The pilot can produce current by rubbing his gloves together or
moving his hands. This electricity will be fed to the battery. A carbon
nanotube spring can be used in the bionic boots. A stationary magnet
within the spring will mean that whenever the spring is compressed and
relaxed there will be a current produced in the spring (due to
electromagnetic induction) that will charge the battery (carbon
nanotubes are very good conductors and also have a release energy to
elastic potential energy ratio that is 2500 times that of a hardened
steel spring). The same device that is used to melt water ice can be
used sublimate dry ice (which normally covers the water ice on Mars).
Thankfully, the sublimation point of dry ice on Mars is quite close to
its natural temperature. This means that not that much energy is
required to produce the gaseous CO2. Two tubes that are at a lower
pressure than the main concave container can be attached to the main
container. The CO2 (produced by the sublimation process ) will move
through these tubes, spinning small turbines that will generate current.
This current can also be used to charge the battery.
