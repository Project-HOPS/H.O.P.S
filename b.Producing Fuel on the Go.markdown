##Problem:##

Imagine youâ€™re almost out of fuel before reaching your base, what do you
do?

##Solution:##

Water ice can be harvested, and by using a device (container with a
lens) that magnifies the sunlight on mars (of intensity 590 W/m\^2), can
be concentrated onto a single focal point within a concave container.
The ice will lie on this focal point. The container, depending on where
you are on Mars, must be pressurized so that the ice does not sublimate.
When the ice melts the resulting water can be used to produce hydrogen
and oxygen using electrolysis.

Simple and light (pressurized) apparatus
can be used to carry out the electrolysis. Microbial electrolysis can
also be used in an emergency situation.
