##How would you calculate everything?##

Let me give you an example. Say you need to climb to a height of 3m(B) and then get back down while traveling a horizontal distance of say 14 meters(A to C), in a time of 60 seconds, how much total power would you need?

There are 3 points on our diagram that have changes in power output. Those are A,B and C.
While the pilot is moving from A to B, he needs to increase it's thrust both horizontally and vertically.
Hence we're left with a horizontal(Ph) and a vertical(Pv) power output.

1.Pv = F*y/t 		 F = mg + ma = 607.91 + 164.3*a (a = 3 m/s^2) = 1100.81 N
2.Pv = 1100.81*3/t		t = 30s
3.Pv = 1100.81*3/30
4.Pv = 110.08 W

***

1.Ph = F*x/t		F = m*a (a = 3 m/s^2) = 164.3* 3 = 492.9 N
2.Ph = 492.9*14/t		t = 60s
3.Ph = 492.9*14/60
4.Ph = 115.01 W
