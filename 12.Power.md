##How would you calculate everything?##

Let me give you an example. Say you need to climb to a height of 3m(B) and then get back down while traveling a horizontal distance of say 14 meters(A to C), in a time of 60 seconds, how much total power would you need?

There are 3 points on our diagram that have changes in power output. Those are A,B and C.
While the pilot is moving from A to B, he needs to increase it's thrust both horizontally and vertically.
Hence we're left with a horizontal(Ph) and a vertical(Pv) power output.

###Vertical Power:###
---

1.Pv = F*y/t 		 F = mg + ma = 607.91 + 164.3*a (a = 3 m/s^2) = 1100.81 N

2.Pv = 1100.81*3/t		t = 30s

3.Pv = 1100.81*3/30

4.Pv = 110.08 W

###Horizontal Powe:r###
---

1.Ph = F*x/t		F = m*a (a = 3 m/s^2) = 164.3* 3 = 492.9 N

2.Ph = 492.9*14/t		t = 60s

3.Ph = 492.9*14/60

4.Ph = 115.01 W
***
#####After you've finished calculating the horizontal and vertical components, you can calculate the total Power by using the Pythagoras theorem:#####

P total = Ph / cosθ  

P total = Pv / sinθ	

Ph / cosθ = Pv / sinθ    

115.01 / cosθ = 110.08 / sinθ

tanθ = 110.08  / 115.01

θ = 43.75

P Total = 159.2 W
