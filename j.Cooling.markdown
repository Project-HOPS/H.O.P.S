##Problem:##

How will the thrusters be stopped from overheating?

##Solution:##

The hydrogen will be pumped in just before the oxygen. It will cool the
thruster down and then it will burn in oxygen to produce thrust. Dry ice
could also be used to cool the engine. CO2, or 'Martian air', could be
pumped through the thruster to cool it down.
As H.O.P.S. takes off, the temperature and the atmospheric gases will drop even more, so the higher altitudes will help with the high temperatures. Moreover, as the average temperature on mars is -56.6 C with the highest being 27 C in the summer, the outside temperature will act as a sort of cooling to the inside one.
