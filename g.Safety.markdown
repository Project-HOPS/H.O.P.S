##Problem:##

How can the safety of the astronaut be guaranteed?

##Solution:##

To avoid any burning hazards to the astronaut, the thruster will have a
safety mechanism that will only allow it to be at a certain minimum
angle away from the pilot. If there is a failure in the electronics and
the thrusters go out of control, the thrusters will not be able to move
too close to the pilot and potentially harm him. The belt of the jetpack will allow him to be safe from sudden impacts up to a point by being able to bend in all directions on the springs.

The oxygen and hydrogen will only come in contact with each otherÂ in the
thruster as they will travel through separate pipes. This means that
combustion only occurs in the thruster and not in other parts of the jetpack.

In extreme cases of emergencies, such as the failure of one of four thrusters, thrust vectoring and the fact that we have 4 instead of 2 thrusters will come into play. The same concept that is used to move will be applied in such cases. The undamaged thrusters, 3 of 4 in this case, will rotate and move in such a way so as to safely land the pilot to the nearest surface. In cases of failure where the safety mechanism doesn't have enough time to react, the bionic boots and the Wireframe(if you're using the G.H.O.P.S.) will absorb the shock of the impact and roll you to a stop once the heavy plate aligns itself.

The general idea of the G.H.O.P.S. is to be used as a safety measure in dangerous explorations on Mars, as it not only prevents you from hurting yourself on impacts but also provides a kind of shield for dust storms, rocks and cliffs. The fact that it can be used while flying as it's lightweight is an extra advantage.
