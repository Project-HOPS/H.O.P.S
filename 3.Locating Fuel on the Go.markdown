##Problem:##

How would you locate jetpack fuel while you’re actually using it?

##Solution:##

There are five satellites currently orbiting Mars. 3 to 4 of these are
needed for a GPS system with an accuracy of a meter. Satellite imagery,
a GPS location system (including a GPS tracker embedded in the helmet)
and a spectrometer (also embedded in the helmet) can be used to detect
and locate water ice. The spectrometer will have a wide range (approximately 325 nm to 1075nm with an uncertainty of +-0.1nm) and will be made of a protective material for extreme temperatures.
