##Problem:##

How would you locate jetpack fuel while you’re actually using it?

##Solution:##

There are five satellites currently orbiting Mars. 3 to 4 of these are
needed for a GPS system with an accuracy of a meter. Satellite imagery,
a GPS location system (including a GPS tracker embedded in the helmet)
and a spectrometer (also embedded in the helmet) can be used to detect
and locate water ice. The spectrometer will have a wide range (approximately 325 nm to 1075nm with an uncertainty of +-0.1nm) and will be made of a protective material for extreme temperatures.
Another optional method of locating ice on Mars would be using extremely fast and accurate infrared cameras PI 400/PI 450 which are the smallest thermographic cameras in their class. They have a measurement speed of 80 Hz and an optical resolution of 382 x 288 pixels. The model optris PI 400 can detect a temperature range of -20C up to 900C or 1500C for the upgradeable model. Covering these IR cameras or similar/more suitable ones with proper materials to offer protection will make them ideal for such situations. Moreover, when ice yeats up, it turns into a gas that pushes against the sand as it comes out. When the block of ice is on the and surface, we see that the sand is just a little bit warmer. By detecting these slightest differences, we can detect the blocks.
