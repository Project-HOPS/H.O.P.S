##Problem:##

How would you produce fuel for the jetpack at home base?

##Solution:##
Oxygen can be produced by the decomposition of CO2 (Mars' atmosphere is
made up of 96% CO2). Water can be produced by the 'Sabatier reaction':
CO2 +4H2 ==&gt; 2H2O + CH4    -165 kJ/mol, this also takes advantage of
the Martian atmosphere. The methane produced can be used as an everyday
fuel at base camp. Microbial electrolysis can be used to split the urea
in urine into hydrogen and oxygen.

The carbon dioxide electrolysis process is used in the Reference Mission to provide the needed additional oxygen. The process converts the atmospheric carbon dioxide directly into oxygen and carbon monoxide using zirconia cells at high temperature. The zirconia cell system is not as well developed as the Sabatier process but is under development.This process eliminates the overproduction of methane during propellant production except during the first mission when the Sabatier produced water is also needed. 
•Ancillary Systems - Systems for atmosphere intake, product liquefaction,and product storage and transfer will be needed. These systems have not been detailed for the Reference Mission at this stage of study but their necessary functions can be described. The filter and compressor equipment cleans the martian atmosphere of dust and compresses it to a pressure usable by the rest of the ISRU plant. Product liquefaction must include cryogenic liquefaction of oxygen, methane and nitrogen as well as condensation of the water stored as cached reserves. Storage systems will include cryogenic tanks for cached oxygen and buffer gasses. An expandable bladder-type tank is anticipated for cached water. Propellant storage will be accomplished in the MAV tanks and so is not considered part of the ISRU system.
