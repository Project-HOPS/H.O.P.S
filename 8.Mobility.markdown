How is H.O.P.S. mobile?

****Solution:****

While in flight, the position of the arm of each thruster is fixed.
However, when on foot, the astronaut can fold up these arms, unlock
their position on the belt and move them to the back of the belt for
better mobility. The thrusters, due to the material they're composed of
(carbon fiber), will be lightweight. The astronaut will also be able to
easily move around due to the flexibility the bionic boots provide. A
flexibility that is shared by nature, as ostriches use the same
“technology”(called Achilles tendon of an ostrich) in their feet to move
around, reaching speeds as high as 45 miles per hour, on Earth.
