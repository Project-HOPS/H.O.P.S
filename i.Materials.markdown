##Problem:##

What materials will H.O.P.S. be made of?

##Solution:##

[C/SiC]Ceramic Matrix Composite(CMC) of Carbon Fibre and Silicon Carbide(SiC): used for the thrusters, thruster-arms and bionic boots
(Carbon Fibre Melting temp. of 3500 degrees Celsius- on Earth. Temperature of the
combustion of hydrogen in each thruster is around 2300 degrees Celsius-
on Mars). SiC will also be the material the Wireframe of G.H.O.P.S. will be made of. It is a material of low density(3.21 g/cm^3) and of high tensile strength(about 0.1360 GPa). It is also resistant to cracking and denting.


Kevlar: Used for compressed gas fuel tanks and for insulation of the
thrusters.

Quartz: Piezoelectric material that coats part of the gloves.
