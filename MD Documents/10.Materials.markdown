****Problem:****

What materials will H.O.P.S. be made of?

****Solution:****

Carbon Fiber: used for the thrusters, thruster-arms and bionic boots
(Melting temp. of 3500 degrees Celsius- on Earth. Temperature of the
combustion of hydrogen in each thruster is around 2300 degrees Celsius-
on Mars)

Kevlar: Used for compressed gas fuel tanks and for insulation of the
thrusters.

Quartz: Piezoelectric material that coats part of the gloves.
