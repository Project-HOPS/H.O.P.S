****Problem:****

How will the thrusters be stopped from overheating?

****Solution:****

The hydrogen will be pumped in just before the oxygen. It will cool the
thruster down and then it will burn in oxygen to produce thrust. Dry ice
could also be used to cool the engine. CO2, or Martian 'air', could be
pumped through the thruster to cool it down.
