****Problem:****

How can the safety of the astronaut be guaranteed?

****Solution:****

To avoid any burning hazards to the astronaut, the thruster will have a
safety mechanism that will only allow it to be at a certain minimum
angle away from the pilot. If there is a failure in the electronics and
the thrusters go out of control, the thrusters will not be able to move
too close the pilot and potentially harm him.

The oxygen and hydrogen will only come in contact with each otherÂ in the
thruster as they will travel through separate pipes. This means that
combustion only occurs in the thruster and not in other parts of the
soot.
