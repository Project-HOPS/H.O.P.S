What is G.H.O.P.S.?

****Answer:****

The Gyroscopic H.O.P.S. consists of two main components: a spherical
wire outer frame and an inner pole with a differently-weighted concave
plate at each end. These two parts rotate about each other. The bottom
plate will be heavier than the top one. The thrusters will apply a force
with a large horizontal component so that the center of gravity is
displaced from its lowest position. In other words, the heavier plate
will rotate to where it is behind the astronaut. The ball will now roll
forward due to the thrust exerted and due to the moment produced by the
return of the heavier plate to its starting position. When H.O.P.S. is
rolling, the astronaut will be rocking back and forth in his seat. If
the thrusters exert thrust with a great enough vertical component,
H.O.P.S. will lift off the ground and will be able to fly as normal.

Another advantage of Gyroscopic H.O.P.S. is that it's much safer due to the heavier part being at the bottom, hence if anything malfunctions or stops working the pilot will not topple over or fall onto his head. The wireframe also offers some protection both from impacts by absorbing most of the shock and other external forces. This is achieved by coating the outer wireframe with a layer of rubber.
