****Problem:****

Arenâ€™t there other, easier fuels you could use? Why not use them?

****Solution:****

The combustion of hydrogen is an incredibly efficient reaction. It also produces a large amount of energy of -572 kJ/mol. We initially thought of reacting CO2 with Mg(2 Mg + CO2 > 2 MgO + C). However, this produces solid byproducts like soot(Carbon) and Magnesium oxide that coat/clog the engine, preventing it from functioning. This soot might also cause overheating and damage to the thrusters. 
We also considered using plasma, but apart from the fact that plasma technology is not that advanced yet, an incredible amount of energy is needed to produce it. It would also be an extremely dangerous propellant due to its high temperature (some thousands degrees Celsius).
Ion propulsion would be another option, but the problem with using ion propulsion is that it would take far too long to accelerate the pilot to a decent speed.Moreover, Ion thrusters do not produce their own power and an external power source must be used. Another downside is that it does not allow for sharp maneuverability.
