****Problem:****

Arenâ€™t there other, easier fuels you could use? Why not use other fuels?

****Solution:****

The combustion of hydrogen is an incredibly efficient reaction. It also
produces a large amount of energy -572 kJ/mol. We initially thought of
reacting CO2 with Mg however this produces solid byproducts like soot
that coat the engine, preventing it from functioning.

In addition, the problem with using plasma is that an incredible amount
of energy is needed to be produced. It would also be an extremely
dangerous propellant due to its high temperature (some thousands degrees
Celsius).

Moreover, the problem with using ion propulsion is that it would take
far too long to accelerate the pilot to a decent speed. It also does not
allow for sharp maneuverability.
