Arenâ€™t there other, easier fuels you could use? Why not use them?

****Solution:****

The combustion of hydrogen is an incredibly efficient reaction. It also produces a large amount of energy -572 kJ/mol. We initially thought of reacting CO2 with Mg(2 Mg + CO2 > 2 MgO + C) however this produces solid byproducts like soot(Carbon) and Magnesium oxide that coat/clog the engine, preventing it from functioning. 
We also considered using plasma, but apart from the fact that plasma technology is not that advanced yet, an incredible amount of energy is needed to be produced. It would also be an extremely dangerous propellant due to its high temperature (some thousands degrees Celsius).
 Ion propulsion would be another option, but the problem with using ion propulsion is that it would take far too long to accelerate the pilot to a decent speed while also requiring an external force to produce power. Another downside is that it does not allow for sharp maneuverability.
